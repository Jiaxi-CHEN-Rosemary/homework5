## Tips
1. The video format may not play in some versions of Safari. If you are having trouble and using Safari, try Chrome or Firefox. 
2. Look things up! W3schools has a great HTML Audio/Video DOM Reference (https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp). So does HTML5Rocks.com (https://web.dev/learn/).
 

## Submission Requirements
